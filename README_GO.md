# AML System - Go Implementation

High-performance, real-time AML monitoring system built with Go for optimal speed and resource efficiency.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+
- Google Cloud SDK configured
- BigQuery access

### Setup
```bash
# Download dependencies
make deps

# Build all tools
make build

# Or use the quick setup
make setup
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```
cmd/
├── upload/     # CSV upload and immediate processing
└── monitor/    # Real-time data monitoring

sql/            # BigQuery SQL scripts
Makefile        # Build and run commands
go.mod          # Go module dependencies
```

## 🛠️ Tools

### 1. Upload Tool
Uploads CSV to BigQuery and triggers immediate AML processing.

```bash
# Upload specific file
make upload CSV=new_transactions.csv

# Upload default file (credit_card_transactions.csv)
make upload

# Development mode
make run-upload CSV=your_file.csv
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking
- ✅ Colored terminal output
- ✅ File validation and verification
- ✅ Immediate AML processing trigger
- ✅ Error handling and retry logic

### 2. Real-Time Monitor
Continuously monitors BigQuery table for changes and triggers processing automatically.

```bash
# Start real-time monitoring
make monitor

# Development mode
make run-monitor
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Real-time row count monitoring (every 30 seconds)
- ✅ Automatic processing trigger on new data
- ✅ Alert summary reporting
- ✅ Graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C)
- ✅ Memory efficient (< 50MB RAM)

## 💰 Performance & Cost

### Resource Usage
- **Upload Tool**: ~30MB RAM, runs for seconds
- **Monitor**: ~20-50MB RAM, runs continuously
- **CPU**: Minimal usage (< 5%)

### Cost Efficiency
- **BigQuery**: Free tier (< 1TB processing/month)
- **Cloud Run**: $3-8/month (only when dashboard accessed)
- **Total**: ~$3-8/month for complete AML system

## 🔄 Workflows

### Batch Processing
```bash
# 1. Upload new data
make upload CSV=today_transactions.csv

# 2. Processing happens immediately
# 3. Dashboard shows fresh alerts
```

### Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
# 1. Start monitor
make monitor

# 2. Upload data from another terminal
make upload CSV=new_data.csv

# 3. Monitor detects changes and processes automatically
```

## 🏗️ Building for Production

### Single Platform
```bash
make build
```

### Multi-Platform
```bash
make build-all
# Creates binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows
```

### Global Installation
```bash
make install
# Installs to /usr/local/bin/
# Use: aml-upload or aml-monitor from anywhere
```

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

```dockerfile
# Add to existing Dockerfile for Cloud Run
COPY bin/upload /usr/local/bin/aml-upload
COPY bin/monitor /usr/local/bin/aml-monitor
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=anlaytics-465216
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service-account.json
```

### Monitoring Interval
Edit `cmd/monitor/main.go`:
```go
const MonitorInterval = 10 * time.Second // Check every 10 seconds
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
```bash
# Login with gcloud
gcloud auth application-default login

# Set project
gcloud config set project anlaytics-465216
```

### BigQuery Permissions
```bash
# Grant BigQuery access to service account
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding anlaytics-465216 \
    --member="serviceAccount:aml-service-account@anlaytics-465216.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/bigquery.dataEditor"
```
